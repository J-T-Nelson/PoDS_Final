# PoDS_Final

Principles of Data Science final project, Corn Kernel image Classification

This project reached completion for the class, however I will be continuing with the work in the coming weeks in order to more deeply study this simple image classification problem. I intend to improve performance by testing novel models, preprocesing techniques, and feature extraction techniques in different combinations. The end goal of further work for this project is to reach similar levels of prediction accuracy as those who are in the top 10 of the [original Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-pog-series-s01e03/overview), and further to write a detailed report on techniques used and my understanding of why perofrmance improvements were found when and where they come about in the development process.
